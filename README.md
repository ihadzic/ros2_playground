## What is this?

This repository contains some rather trivial ROS2 code. It's for myself to figure out ROS vs. ROS2 differences and work things out before transitioning my real work code to ROS2. Since there is not much interesting functionality here, I figured I use public Github to store it. If you find it useful, MIT license applies.
